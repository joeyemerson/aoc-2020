# Advent of Code 2020

This purpose of this repo is to learn the C++ programming language. I anticipate many challenges and less-than-optimal code (both in terms of readability and performance). It should be fun to look back after the month's coding problems are complete and see what I've learned and how far I've come since the start.

Big kudos to Eric Wastl for organizing this event every year!
